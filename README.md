When using GitHub, it is important to have a professional README available to users.  This information will contain information about the app - how it is used, how it is installed, how to test it, how to contribute, and what licensing was used.   This README generator will take the stress out of having to make a README for users.   Simply by entering information about the user's app via the command line, a wonderful README is dynamically created.
